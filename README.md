# Card-Game

Swift is a multi-paradigm programming language, but mainly oriented to protocol, thanks to its two key words: protocol, extension. For a better understanding of this notions, first of all we must focus on object-oriented development.

This project will focus on a classic 52 cards game through various small exercises 
that are meant to familiarize you with swift and make you use several notions:

1) The declarations: var, let, type, weak, optional to know how to type your vari- ables.

2) Control structures: loop, conditions, if let to structure your code.

3) Classes: class, func, overload, override, struct, enum, inheritance, extension,
mutating for object-oriented development.

4) Algo: closures for the anonymous functions.
